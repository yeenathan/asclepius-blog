Designing the visuals for Remedify was a collaborative journey that balanced simplicity, functionality, and user-friendliness. From the logo to the icons, characters, and instructional graphics, every element was crafted to create a consistent and welcoming experience for our users. Here’s a look at how our team brought these visuals to life.
# Color Scheme
Our color palette set the tone for the app’s visual identity. Vibrant primary colors—Princeton orange, Hunyadi yellow, and light orange—add energy and warmth, while secondary colors like pale aqua, Persian green, light green, and light blue evoke calm and trust. Seashell, a neutral tertiary color, grounds the design. Inspired by medication and home remedy containers, as well as calming and friendly environments, the palette fosters warmth, welcome, and stability, forming the foundation of our visuals.
# Logo
The journey began with the logo, which we designed to reflect health and medicine through the imagery of the Rod of Asclepius. After exploring various drafts, we settled on a minimalistic concept: an exclamation point to symbolize alerts, intertwined with a snake to evoke the Rod. Our green-and-yellow color palette brought the design to life, establishing the visual foundation for the app.
# Icons
Next, we turned our attention to iconography. These icons represented different medication types—pills, injections, and liquids—using clean, rounded shapes to maintain a friendly and approachable feel. By sticking to our color scheme, we ensured consistency across the app’s visuals.
# Onboarding Graphics
For the onboarding experience, we created cartoon-style character graphics to welcome users in a neutral and inclusive way. Simple designs and a consistent palette tied the characters to the rest of the app while emphasizing approachability.
# Scanning Graphics
Lastly, we developed an outline-based graphics for the medication scanning feature. This visual serves as a clear, functional visual assistor, guiding users on how to capture images of their medication labels and DIN numbers without distraction.
Throughout the process, we stayed focused on creating visuals that were purposeful, cohesive, and user-focused. Every element contributed to shaping Remedify into a tool that is not only practical but also visually inviting for all users.

We're excited to share our latest updates as we move forward with the design of our medication reminder app, tailored for elderly users and those with memory challenges.

## Moodboard
Our design process began with crafting a moodboard that embodies the essence of our app. The selected images convey warmth, support, and professionalism, creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages users to engage with the app confidently.

## Typography
We have chosen Poppins as our primary font due to its friendly and rounded appearance, making it both approachable and professional. This sans-serif font ensures clarity and readability, which is essential for our target audience. We're utilizing bold for headings and subheadings to enhance visibility.

## Color Palette
Our color palette includes:
Primary colors: Vivid Orange and Soft Orange for energy and warmth.
Secondary colors: Pale Aqua and Persian Green for calm and trust.
Tertiary color: Seashell for a neutral background.

## Next Steps
Weâ€™re focusing on finalizing the style guide assets and working on our logo design. Stay tuned for more updates as we move closer to launching!

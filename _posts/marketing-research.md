We’d love to share our vision for the design of our marketing advertisement video, crafted to resonate with our audience and convey our message with impact and creativity.

## Ideation Validation Research
In the process of creating our app, the team had to determine our key values in order to develop our idea any further. As improvement to medical adherence and accessibility were prioritized key values, this helped us narrow down our scope about what to research and who our target audience may be. The information gathering team dived deeper into medical adherence and provided the Asclepius team with secondary research such as the types of medical adherence and the common causes of it. The conclusion was to target users who are prone to polypharmacy and cognitive impairments such as ADHD or dementia. 

## Target Audience
When developing our concept we must consider who our app is targeted for and make sure that aligns with our advertisement. As our app is marketed towards people with cognitive impairments, we must remember to create a story that aligns with the users. We have a vision to create an advertisement video that resembles the perspective of a person who struggles with ADHD that may lead to unintentional non-adherence.

## The Concept and Execution
Based on our research into what’s possible in Premiere Pro, competitor’s advertisement videos and short films related to our target audience, we've determined the basic frames and how we will enhance the advertisement through post production. We intend to present our idea outside of basic visual cues and dialogue through incorporation of compelling audio as well as striking visuals to supplement the sound design.


## Moving Forward
Our focus will be on finalizing the key elements of our video campaign. This includes conceptualizing the frames and story beats and ensuring it’s done in a way that resonates with our target audience, particularly those with impairments like ADHD. We'll begin to develop a storyboard, sketching out the sequence, and ensuring it reflects our core message. To enhance the video’s impact, we will explore methods to incorporate compelling sound design and striking visuals utilizing tools included in Premiere Pro, as well as other tools where available/necessary. It's also essential to continuously verify that our creative direction remains aligned with both our core values and the needs of our audience, ensuring our campaign is not only engaging but also meaningful and reflective of our mission.

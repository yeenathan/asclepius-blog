Our development team recently made an exciting breakthrough in utilizing images to extract and display text on another page or site. In a successful test, we used a nutrient label from a food package image and accurately transferred the label’s text to a different webpage. While this feature currently works with pre-existing images, we’re actively working on extending this functionality to work with live camera input, which we aim to achieve soon.

Additionally, we’ve conducted research on existing applications to identify features that could be improved and to avoid pitfalls common in similar tools. This helps us stay ahead in optimizing our solution and ensuring we create a seamless user experience.

On the UI front, after evaluating various React Native frameworks, we've largely settled on UIKitten, a choice recommended by Henry. Its pre-built components and user-friendly interface have earned approval from most of the team, but we're staying open to alternatives as we continue to refine our approach.

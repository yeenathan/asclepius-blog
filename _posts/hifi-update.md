As the semester draws to a close, we’re nearing the presentation date for Remedify! In this blog, we’ll be
covering the highlights of our updated high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype and the design language that ties it all
together.
## Design Updates and Highlights
Our design process started with a carefully curated moodboard, capturing the essence of Remedify. The
imagery embodies warmth, support, and professionalism, setting the tone for an inviting and user-friendly
app experience.
## Quick Daily Actions on the Homepage
The homepage now features a prominent “Mark as Taken” button as the primary call-to-action (CTA),
allowing users to log medications quickly. This addition simplifies daily interactions, particularly for users
who prioritize efficiency and ease of use.
## Organized Medication Library
Medications are now displayed as visually organized cards in the library, presenting key details like
dosage and frequency at a glance. This streamlined layout supports intuitive navigation and reduces
cognitive load, making it easier for users to stay informed.
## Color-Coded Medication Schedule
To give users a clear overview of their day, medications on the homepage are color-coded by time of
day—morning, lunch, and dinner. This simple yet effective system allows users to quickly track what they
need to take and when, fostering confidence and consistency.
## Refined Manual Input and Scanning
The manual input and scanning pages have been refined to align with the app’s overall design language.
These updates ensure consistency across features, delivering a polished and cohesive experience that’s
both intuitive and professional.
## Typography
For typography, we’ve selected two fonts to balance aesthetics and functionality. Poppins, with its
rounded, friendly design, serves as the primary font, ensuring a professional yet approachable feel. To
enhance visual hierarchy and readability, we’ve added Public Sans as a secondary font. This pairing
allows for clear differentiation between headings, subheadings, and body text while maintaining overall
cohesiveness.
## The Thought Behind the Design
Our design language blends modernity with approachability to create a visually engaging yet functional
interface. Rounded edges, clean layouts, and soft color tones establish a sense of trust and warmth,
reflecting the app’s mission to support users in managing their medication routines.
The addition of Public Sans as a secondary font reinforces clarity, especially in detailed text-heavy areas,
ensuring the user experience is as intuitive as it is aesthetically pleasing.
## Looking Ahead
With these updates, we’re proud to say that Remedify is nearly complete! As we approach the finish line
and prepare to present our hard work, we’re excited to share the results of this journey with you. Stay
tuned for the final reveal—we can’t wait to showcase everything we’ve accomplished!

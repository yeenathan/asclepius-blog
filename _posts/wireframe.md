Our app aims to simplify medication management for individuals, particularly individuals, who may have multiple medications and require gentle reminders to take their medications on time. Based on user surveys, secondary research, and competitive analysis, we developed a user flow chart and site map to enhance user experience and ensure all essential steps are covered. From these, we created a wireframe to visualize the app's interface and functionality.

## Site Map
The site map serves as a blueprint for our app's structure. It helps us clarify our main features and ensure easy access for users. The app will include the following key pages:
- **Home:** Home screen will feature a medication schedule view, displaying upcoming reminders and medication times at a glance.
- **Add Medication:** Users can easily add medication by scanning medication with a camera or inputting manually.
- **Medication Library:** Users can see and manage their medications and their reminder as needed.
- **Account Settings:** Account setting will allow users to add family members who can monitor their medication as well as adjust general app settings, including font size and language.

## User Flow Chart
Accessibility is one of our core values. To enhance user experience, we eliminated unnecessary steps in the user flow chart. Here are some key aspects:
- **AI Photo Recognition for Medication Input:** Adding new medication reminders can be done through our scanning feature, which utilizes AI photo recognition to minimize manual input. We also provide a manual input option for those who prefer it.
- **Quick Dose Logging:** Each medication card on the home screen features a convenient "Mark as Taken" button, allowing users to log their medication intake with a single tap. This design makes tracking doses quick and effortless.

## Wireframe
With our site map and user flow chart as guiding documents, we’ve built the wireframe for our app. Informed by insights from our competitive analysis regarding user interface and experience, we are focused on making our app user-friendly while aligning with our target audience’s needs. The wireframe will provide a visual representation of the app's layout, highlighting how users will interact with each feature.

## Next Steps
Our next steps involve creating a high-fidelity prototype using the color palette established in our style guide. Stay tuned for updates!

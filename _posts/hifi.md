We’re excited to unveil our high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype, which incorporates thoughtful design elements to make medication management simpler and more accessible for our primary users—individuals who are prone to polypharmacy and cognitive impairments. Building on insights from user surveys, our site map, and user flow chart, this prototype brings our vision to life with a focus on usability and support.
## Design Highlights
Our hi-fi prototype utilizes the colors from our style guide, creating an inviting and professional look that’s both supportive and easy to navigate. Key design choices help enhance user experience and accessibility:

**Larger Font Sizes:** We’ve used larger font sizes to ensure clear information display on mobile devices. Users can also adjust text size within the app for optimal readability, making it easier for them to track their medication schedules comfortably.

**Rounded Component Borders:** All components have rounded edges, giving the interface a soft and welcoming appearance. This design choice reduces visual strain, creating a friendlier experience while still maintaining a professional feel.

**Icons and Graphics:** Our app is visually enriched with icons and graphics to guide users through each feature intuitively. These visuals break up text, keeping the interface lively and reducing cognitive load, helping users quickly understand functions and navigate the app with ease.

**Error Handling:** We’ve integrated helpful error messages throughout the app. For example, if a scan fails or if a reminder entry is incomplete, clear prompts guide users on what actions to take. This approach helps users feel supported rather than frustrated, reducing barriers to using the app.

**Quick Dose Logging:** Each medication card on the home screen features a "Mark as Taken" button, highlighted in orange, allowing users to track doses with one tap. This function is designed to be straightforward, especially for users who may not be comfortable navigating complex interfaces.

## Next Steps
Our next phase involves conducting user testing to gather feedback on the hi-fi prototype. This will allow us to make targeted refinements, ensuring the app meets the needs of our target audience and provides a seamless, user-friendly experience.
Stay tuned for more updates as we perfect the app and bring this valuable tool one step closer to release!
